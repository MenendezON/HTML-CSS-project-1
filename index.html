            <p class="text">
                The Anker Powerhouse 200 is a 218 watt/hour portable power station with diverse charging ports: 12 volt DC (car cigarette lighter), 2 USB 3, 1 USB-C power delivery, and an AC 110 volt outlet. It weighs  6 lbs. and comes with a handle for carrying. Itâ€™s sleek, modern design looks good in any setting.

                <h3>DESIGNS AND FEATURES</h3>
                Chances are, you already own an Anker charger or know someone who does. Anker chargers are dependable, easy to use, and come in all sizes and power ratings for all budgets. The Powerhouse 200 is their newest large capacity power source for short-term outages, camping trips, or other get-togethers where power is not available.
                At 6 lbs, the Powerhouse 200 is easy to carry and move around where needed. It has an LCD screen that indicates battery life so you always know how much juice you have left. 
                There are 5 power-out ports on one end of the Powerhouse 200 and one power-in port at the other end. I like this setup. Other power stations I use have the power-in port on the same side as the power-out ports making it a bit awkward for charging with many cords connected. Connecting and disconnecting was easy. The weight of the unit helps hold it in place allowing for a one-handed connection. Its thick, silicone handle makes it easy to carry room to room as needed.
